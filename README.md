Solutions for [Euler Project](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

All solutions are implemented in Ruby.

Files with the problem number (e.g. p001.rb) are the standard solutions (using Ruby
standard libraries with a trivial programic way). The files use the simplest
and minimum code to solve the problem. Files with '-a' (e.g. p001-a.rb) are
alternative ways to solve the solution. Some use self defined Ruby methods to
solve the problem. Some solve the problem in a non-trivial way.
